This repository consists of a range of problem solving which is done in Dart.

Solved: Take a string input like "543L24R6" and replace "L" with previous element & "R" with next
element(54332466). Write a program to modify string as per L/R & check the string whether
it is palindrome or not. [See Problem no.4]
